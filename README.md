palindrome check:
=====================
Palindrome function

- Storing the string in a character array.
- creating a temp character array property and assigning length(no of characters) to initialize that array.
- reversing the string character and storing in the temp character array.
- creating a `flag` and assigning it to `true`.
-if character array and temp char array is same then i am not doing anything.
- If character array is not matching then assigning flag as false. Which means it is not a palindrome
